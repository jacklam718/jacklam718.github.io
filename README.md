### First time setup
- Install hugo

- Build and Deployment
Now check out the gh-pages branch into your public folder using gitâ€™s worktree feature. Essentially, the worktree allows you to have multiple branches of the same local repository to be checked out in different directories: `rm -rf public git worktree add -B gh-pages public upstream/gh-pages`

### Deployment
`./scripts/publish_toghpages.sh`
